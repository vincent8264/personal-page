    excerpt: "I am a master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC San Diego with a strong interest in machine learning, data science, and their applications to scientific and engineering problems. My background includes undergraduate research in data-driven modeling, time-series prediction, and optimization, where I worked with real-world sensor and simulation data. 
    <br><br> 
    Currently, I am specializing in Intelligent Systems and Robotics, where I am building a stronger foundation in robotics and control. By combining this training with my background in data science and machine learning, I aim to develop systems that enable robots to perceive their environment, make informed decisions, and operate robustly in dynamic, practical settings."
