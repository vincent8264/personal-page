     Undergraduate Research Assistant
     
     <small>
     I worked on applying machine learning to real-world scientific data. Learned to design, train, and optimize time-series and predictive models, work with large sensor datasets, and validate results in interdisciplinary research settings.

     <small>
     Through this experience, I developed strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and research-driven problem solving
